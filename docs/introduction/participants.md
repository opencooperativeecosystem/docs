# Participants

_**Who is currently involved?**_

We are developers as well as facilitators, activists and users of our own applications. We have a committed core team with strong heterogeneous skill set and collectively many decades of experience. We also have looser circles of developers around the core that work on specific apps as needed. We always work in close collaboration with user groups actively working for change, so that all the work remains grounded in real needs, and immediately useful software is created.

In the past several years, we have worked with several food networks, and [sensorica](http://www.sensorica.co/), an open value network that designs open­source hardware. As of over a year ago, we are focusing primarily on the needs of [FairCoop](https://fair.coop/en) and [Bank of the Commons](https://bankofthecommons.coop/), with secondary work with [Mutual Aid Network](http://www.mutualaidnetwork.org/).

_**How is the team organized and structured?**_

The OCE team is an open non­hierarchical group. Our governance is based on open assemblies and consensus decisions. Since our main focus is ecosystem interoperability and interconnections, we welcome any kind of diversity and experiments that can bring values to the ecosystem and can test the boundaries of our protocols and tools

Our workflow so far includes weekly meetings ­ to update ourself about our on going work ­ and monthly meeting to shape together with the ecosystem our roadmap, plus daily chat to foster collaboration and development.  
All our work ­ code, documents, articles ­ are released open­source from the beginning.

We think that a digital cooperative ecosystem nowadays is critical to spread self­management activities and help the creation of alternative realities based on cooperation, decentralisation of power and mutualism. We try to embody these values in the way we craft our software and ensure that the protocols and tools we build allows these possibilities.
