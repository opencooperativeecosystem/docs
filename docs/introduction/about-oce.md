# About OCE

The OCE attempts to be a _**network of inter-connected software and data**_ _**for coope**_rative and post-capitalistic environments _**to**_ bundle the current individualistic approaches of people and collectives into one string and _**synergize efforts towards the same goals**_.

To create this _**framework of inter-connective and decentralized apps and platforms**_, which are freely available, modular, pluggable and well documented, OCE is using _**common vocabularies or protocols**_ \(currently just „ValueFlows“\) _**to convert data seamlessly and instantly**_ from one instance to the other.





_**"We think that a digital cooperative ecosystem nowadays is critical to spread self­management activities and help the creation of alternative realities based on cooperation, decentralisation of power and mutualism. We try to embody these values in the way we craft our software and ensure that the protocols and tools we build allows these possibilities."**_
