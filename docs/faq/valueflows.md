# Valueflows

ValueFlows is a set of common vocabularies to describe flows of economic resources of all kinds within distributed economic ecosystems.

Purpose: to enable internetworking among many different software projects for resource planning and accounting within fractal networks of people and groups. The vocabulary will work for any kind of economic activity, but the focus is to facilitate groups experimenting with solidarity / cooperative / collaborative / small business ecosystem / commons based peer production / any transitional economies. Or, with less buzzwords, "let's help a lot of alternative economic software projects that are solving different pieces of the same puzzle be able to work together".

ValueFlows was initiated to fill a void in the "open app ecosystem" concept several years ago. To make small open apps interoperable and pluggable, common vocabularies and protocols are needed so there isn't a chaotic set of api's that every app needs to accommodate to be able to internetwork. ValueFlows is still in process, but has a critical core of concepts approved by the team.

ValueFlows is used in the OCP api \(currently graphql\).
