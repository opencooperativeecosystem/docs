# OCW

OpenCoop Work Areas is a space where all participants of the FairCoop ecosystem may collaborate and build an organized work flow in a decentralized and efficient way. In addition, it includes a method of logging that work which is divided in tasks among people with the required skills, while distributing a certain value to everyone which contributed. This overall plan is mainly the outcome of the OpenCoop Work Summercamp 2017, where lot of people from around the world, involved in FairCoopâ€™s ecosystem in various ways, gathered and worked on setting this up and kickstarting the new form of selforganizing the open collaborative work for the glocal FairCoop activities.
