# Bank of the Commons

Bank of the Commons is an open cooperative initiative whose objective is to transform banking, payments and currencies in order to support the economy used in cooperative and social movements both at a global and a local level. It is building another economy for a better society.

Bank of the Commons has adopted [FairCoin](http://fair.coop/faircoin/) as a strategic global social currency and blockchain technology upon which to base the development and adoption of decentralized financial structures for the Commons.

Legally, it is based on the networking process of existing cooperative structures in different parts of the world, and on the creation of an European Cooperative Society in Italy, which will take care of the social capital invested in Bank of the Commons, providing it with an independent legal status.
