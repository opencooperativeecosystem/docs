# FairCoop

FairCoop mission is to create an innovative glocal economic system from the bottom up in favor of an alternative and post-capitalist model to pave the way for a collective change towards a life in common. Cooperation, solidarity and transparency are key factors for us to create a truly justice system for everyone. The development and use of powerful interconnected digital tools \(global\) and regional networks \(local\) are crucial for our success. We are using our time and energy constructively and in a collaborative way to create real alternatives by putting theories into action.
