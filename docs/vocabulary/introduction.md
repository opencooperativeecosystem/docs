# Introduction

## What is the Apent App

The Agent App is a work in progress development which is using one common vocabulary, called „valueflows“, to procede economic data from different platforms \(currently just OCP\) with the same vocabulary. \(There are currently no other vocabularies besides ValueFlows for economic networks\)

 At the moment, the App is mainly used by FairCoop \(Agent.Fair.Coop\) focusing on the economic aspect of the community and progressively tailored to its needs. Nevertheless, the agent app can be used by other individuals, collectives or communities as well and can be adapted in the same way.

 To do so, they have three choices: use existing OCP back end deploy the actual OCP back end on their server build a new back end for the agent app

 With the agent app, people and collectives will be able in the future to summarizes their individual accounts, work, memberships, etc. from different platforms simply at just one place – the agent app. All economic relations and data will be visible and manageable from there.

## **What is the relation between the Agent App and OCP?**

 The Open Collaborative Platform \(OCP\) is an open source platform that was adopted by FairCoop to initially manage membership registrations for different projects \(FreedomCoop, BankoftheCommons, Local Nodes etc.\) and is one of the backend data provider for the current agent app.

Due to the advantages of managing economic resources and accounts \(FairCoin wallet integration\), it became the place to organize work and distribute payments appropriately to work commitments in FairCoop. Nevertheless, the platform lacks some intuitive handling due to a wide range of user scenarios options and a rather unappealing user interface, which made it difficult to use. For that reason, it was decided to shape the OCP functionalities just for the specific needs of the FairCoop community by creating the Agent.fair.coop app as the first component of the OCE and convert specific OCP data and functionalities into a user-friendly version with an improved user interface.
